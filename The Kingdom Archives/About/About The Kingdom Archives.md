The Kingdom Archives is a project which aims to collect ancient texts pertaining to the original Hebrew faith and the gospel of the kingdom of God.

## Format
These texts, and relevant supplementary materials and information, are saved in (Obsidian-flavored) Markdown format as an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault for anyone to download and incorporate into their own studies.
