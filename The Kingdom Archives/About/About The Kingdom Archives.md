The Kingdom Archives is a project which aims to collect ancient texts pertaining to the original Hebrew faith and the gospel of the kingdom of God.
## Format
These texts, and relevant supplementary materials and information, are saved in (Obsidian-flavored) Markdown format as an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault for anyone to download and incorporate into their own studies.
Learn more about formatting in this archive in the [[Organization & Style Guide]].

## Text Inclusion And Endorsement
This vault does not currently include any of the books in the modern Protestant canon, for which there are abundant resources. Instead, it focuses on the texts *not* included (for one reason or another) in the Protestant canon.

It should be noted that **inclusion of any ancient text in this archive does NOT imply the particular text is in any way endorsed by the maintainers of this project.** These texts are made available for research and study purposes, and individuals can come to their own conclusions on the biblical significance of the included texts.

Texts in this archive are included due to their professed or alleged significance to the biblical faith, whether or not they are deemed doctrinally sound in their entirety by the maintainers of the project.
